 * \version     1.4.1
 * \brief       This file can optionally be included in projects that use Infineon's 
 *              DC Motor Control Shield with TLE94112
 *              It provides a higher abstraction for controlling motors with the TLE94112 
 *              acting as an output driver
 * 
 * \details
 * The Infineon TLE94112EL DC motor controller shield is able to handle 6 motors with a max. current of 0.9 A
 * independently and additional 5 motors cascaded. The twelve half-bridges can be arranged also together,
 * so that 3 motors with 1.8 A current or one motor with 3.6 A can be used. Each half bridge can
 * provide a high-Voltage (nominal 5.5-18 V) tristate output and max. input voltage of 40V. It is also
 * capable of PWM with 3 different frequencies for controlling the speed of each motor.
 * Have a look at the datasheet for more information.
